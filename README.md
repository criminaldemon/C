Data Structures and Algorithms

The main task of the data structure is to facilitate the computer processing by analyzing the structural characteristics of the data object, including the relationship between the logical structure and the data object, and then representing the logical structure into the physical structure realized by the computer class

An algorithm is a description of a solution to a particular problem and appears as a limited sequence of operations in a computer. After the data types are established, these data types are manipulated to establish a set of operations. The establishment of the operation, the quality of the method directly determines the efficiency of the prototype of the computer program.
